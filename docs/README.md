# Docs

This directory is reserved for durable, repo-local operational documentation for `scryai`.

Performance and Lighthouse documentation now live with each product repository (`~/github/astro-web-template` and `~/github/astro-blog-template`) so quality gates stay coupled to app code.

Current managed-project data-layer baseline: PostgreSQL 18 with Drizzle ORM + Drizzle Kit migrations.
