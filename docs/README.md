# Docs

Durable, repo-local operational documentation for `scryai`.

Product app docs should live with each product repo.

Current stack baseline: Bun, Next.js App Router + Server Actions, React + TypeScript, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Postgres + Drizzle + drizzle-kit, Auth.js (when needed), Zod, and Biome.
