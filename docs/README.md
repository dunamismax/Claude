# Docs

This directory is reserved for durable, repo-local operational documentation for `scryai`.

Performance and Lighthouse documentation now live with each product repository (`~/github/next-web-template` and `~/github/next-blog-template`) so quality gates stay coupled to app code.

Current managed-project baseline: Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript + Zig, PostgreSQL (Dockerized), Drizzle ORM + Drizzle Kit migrations, Better-Auth, Zod, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, and Garage S3-compatible object storage.
